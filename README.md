# MERN-Book-Search-Engine

## Description
This application was refactored from using strictly routing and express, to now implementing GraphQL typeDefs, resolvers and an Apollo Server. The backend uses MongoDB; it mixes Mongoose and GraphQL queries and mutations to run queries and mutations from the UI to the database.

Refactoring this application gave me a good understanding of the power of GraphQL when paired with React. It makes sense that it was developed by Facebook as it makes the routing on the front end of the code base much cleaner.
