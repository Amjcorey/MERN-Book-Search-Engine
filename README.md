# MERN-Book-Search-Engine

## Description of NovelNavigator
This application was refactored from using strictly routing and express, to now implementing GraphQL typeDefs, resolvers and an Apollo Server. The backend uses MongoDB; it mixes Mongoose and GraphQL queries and mutations to run queries and mutations from the UI to the database.

Refactoring this application gave me a good understanding of the power of GraphQL when paired with React.
